## üéì Educational Journey

My academic journey at Johns Hopkins has been a blend of rigorous coursework, practical research, and project-based learning. Here, I've honed my skills in programming languages such as C++ and Python, delved deep into the workings of ROS (Robot Operating System), and mastered simulation environments like Unity. My coursework and projects not only solidified my theoretical understanding but also provided me with hands-on experience in solving real-world problems.

### üõ† Technical Expertise

I bring a diverse set of skills to the table, including:
- Proficiency in **programming languages** (C++, Python, MATLAB), allowing me to tackle complex algorithms and data structures with ease.
- Expertise in **robotic systems** and **automation technologies**, enhanced by my practical experiences with ROS and Unity.
- A solid foundation in **mechatronics and control systems**, underpinned by projects utilizing MATLAB and Simulink.
- Experience in **computer vision and machine learning**, with practical applications using TensorFlow and PyTorch for image recognition and autonomous system navigation.
- A knack for **design and simulation**, demonstrated through my work with CAD tools like SolidWorks and Pro-E, enabling me to visualize and prototype mechanical components and systems.

### üåê Professional Aspirations

As I approach the completion of my Master's degree, I am eagerly looking for opportunities to apply my skills in a dynamic work environment. My goal is to join a forward-thinking company where I can contribute to impactful projects in Robotics, Automation, or Computer Vision. I am particularly interested in roles that challenge me to push the boundaries of current technologies and contribute to innovative solutions.

### üí° Why Me?

What sets me apart is not just my technical expertise but also my passion for learning and innovation. I am a quick learner, adaptable, and thrive in collaborative environments. My academic and project experiences have equipped me with a problem-solving mindset and the ability to work effectively under pressure.

### üîç Looking Ahead

I am excited about the prospect of contributing to projects that make a difference. Whether it's developing advanced robotic systems, enhancing automation technologies, or pushing the limits of computer vision, I am ready to dive in and make a substantial impact.

Let's connect! Whether you're a potential employer, a fellow tech enthusiast, or someone interested in collaboration, I'd love to explore how we can work together to drive innovation forward.
